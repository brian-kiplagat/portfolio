I thought why not use a Xano API instead for my react portfolio.\nSo utilising useEffect and useState combo so that onComponent mount, this page fires a get request to a xano endpoint and xano returns an ordered list of projects in json which i use Array.map()\nto produce a dynamic list of elements. Infact this page your reading now gets json data from a xano database!",

    "description": "I got bored deploying react code on vercel. Coming from a linux backgroud, I wrote my CI-CD Workflow that emulates vercel in my VM to automate code deployment using github actions. I setup a Github Hosted runner and wrote a custom YAML File to enable the runner build, test,Â \nautomatically deploy the app on my RHEL VM. I was able to setup custom users and passwordless SSH Keys that enable runners to automatically SSH into, CD into my deployment directory and deploy my react portfolio. All i have to do is push my JS changes\nincrementally and my workflow will test and deploy my portfolio to my custom domain on an EC2 Instance. I wrote a whole blog on how JS Devs can use github actions, runners, workflows and linux to automate deployments",
